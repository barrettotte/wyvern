# lambda-calculus-rs

An untyped lambda calculus interpreter made to learn the foundations 
of lambda calculus and functional programming.

## Background

Lambda(λ) calculus is a formal system developed by [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) 
to express mathematical functions. It is considered the smallest universal programming language and 
is the foundation of functional programming languages. Lambda calculus (function-based) and Turing machines (state-based)
are both universal models of computation, part of the [Church-Turing Thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis).
